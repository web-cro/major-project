# Project Proposal

## Description

WE have made a similar version of the Lord's mobile Kingdom game. But we have putten our own tricks and maps by keeping the base idea similar. We have done research about the algoridom for pathfinder in order to make the game succesfull and smooth. To keep similarity with the game we have mananged to make the guns moveble and also show the health bar.

## Need to Have List

<!-- - have a pathfinder for the enemies -->
<!-- - be able make multipal targets -->
<!-- - show a health bar for the enemies -->
- be able to place guns at different spots that shot targets
<!-- - keep track of the score -->
<!-- - add different speeds and the numbers of enemies -->
<!-- - give the enemies to ablity to move by themself -->

## Nice to have list
<!-- - have a starting and a ending page -->
<!-- - use local storage to keep track of the high score -->
- some kind of sound effects
- animation of guns and enemies
- keep track of the money and be able to use it to buy guns
- randomising maps
- able to choose different guns
- able to shut off the sound





## To Do
<!-- make a better health bar -->
<!-- make the enemies an array, so we can make multipul enemies, and display -->
<!-- make a timer for the enemies movement -->
<!-- - enemies.isEnemyAlive isn't working -->
<!-- - fix the score and level change function (score = numberOfenemy * 100) and (numberOfenemy = level * 2) -->
<!-- -- MAYBE -- (level = numberOfEnemy % 2) -->
<!-- - make the spawnTime and movementDelay decrease as the game progresses -->
<!-- - find a way to remove enemies from the array -->
- fix the problem where 2 more then need enemies spawn

- SHOWVIK -- working on the gun
